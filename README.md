Hey everyone,

I am Kaan Altıntaş, and I’m from Turkey. I worked two years in a firm as a business analyst → technical purchasing specialist in their hardware team.
Despite wanting to start my career in hardware (until my military service was due), I always felt closer to software development and languages in general, and I’ve been performing as a semi-tester/semi-developer in a modding team for a 17-years old game for four years now.
Overall, I’m not unfamiliar to the software development and testing concepts, and I gained basic to intermediate knowledge about programming in my college lectures.
I have a bit of fascination with things that I know little about and WON’T have much to do with what I’ll be doing in the long run, but I think chasing after what I don’t know will be a curse I’ll be bearing with me for the foreseeable future - hence the hardware detour.
With my military service out of the way and my earlier job terminated, I thought it was a good idea to focus on my original plan now.
Even though I’m a bit late at it (unemployed for 6 months now, though two of them was due to military service and had house-related issues to take care of until the new year), I’ve gone over the ISTQB CTFL syllabus, researched about and gained some basic knowledge in Selenium and Testrail, and now I intend to gain more practical experience and knowledge in software testing in general.
This platform feels like the perfect place to start my next (and most important) leg of my career switch into a software tester, and I am eager to learn and share with all of you.
I hope I’ll be able to contribute here as much as I learn from here in time.

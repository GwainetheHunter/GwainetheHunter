Hey everyone,

I am Kaan Altıntaş, and I’m from Turkey. I worked two years in a firm as a business analyst → technical purchasing specialist in their hardware team.
Despite wanting to start my career in hardware (until my military service was due), I always felt closer to software development and languages in general, and I’ve been performing as a semi-tester/semi-developer in a modding team for a 17-years old game for four years now.
